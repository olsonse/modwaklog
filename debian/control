Description:  AFS Authentication for Apache2
 mod_waklog is an Apache module that provides aklog-like semantics for the web.
 mod_waklog will acquire (and store in the kernel) an AFS credential when a
 connection is opened, use the credential for the duration of the connection,
 and will remove the credential when the connection is closed.
